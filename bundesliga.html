	<h3> Bayern Munich vs. Borussia Dortmund</h3>
		<p><article> Tactically, Bayern Munich was fine; Julian Nagelsmann got it right. That being said, the backline got caught in some transitional and dicey moments. Joshua Kimmich’s rash challenge in the box and a couple of rash challenges by Benjamin Pavard could have led to Bayern Munich waiting longer for the title. Manuel Neuer has had more than his usual number of scuffed passes lately.

Nonetheless, Borussia Dortmund adapted their approach for this game, setting up to cut off spaces as well as to take less risks than they usually do. Bayern used short passing chains to play through the press and countered effectively whenever they could. Overall, the tactics, and Bayern, were effective. I know I praise Jamal Musiala all the time, but he deserves it. He scored the goal which sealed the title. Bayern Munich has an incredible gem in their ranks, and the team is so lucky to have him. He belongs in this team and that becomes obvious with each passing game.

Leon Goretzka’s injury-induced absence might have led to the drop off in the form of the team in the crucial moments of the season. His presence, ability to glide past defenders despite his size, ability to shield the back-line and move forward whenever needed are the qualities which makes him a starter in this team. Clearly, when he is absent, this team drops down a couple of levels.

As for Julian Nagelsmann, I watched his post match interview with Bastian Schweinsteiger and despite the title win (he is Bavarian after all!), he seemed to be aware of the fact that things will need to improve ahead of next season. Although nobody asked him about the Villarreal games, he brought the games up himself. I don’t ever really give Nagelsmann credit and the jury is still out on the hybrid back three/four — that being said, a mark of a good coach is to reflect on the low points of the season. I hope to see better from Nagelsmann next season. I don’t necessarily think it will work but for now, Nagelsmann deserves a bit of praise.</article></p>
<h3> Bayer Leverkusen vs. Mainz</h3>
<p><article> Leverkusen came into Matchday 23 with the Bundesliga’s second most prolific attack but actually found themselves under constant pressure from a Mainz side hoping to move from ninth into the European places. Lukas Hradecky did really well to react and keep out a sweetly struck Anton Stach effort before also denying Silvan Widmer from a tight angle. The 05ers looked certain to take the lead on the half-hour mark after Jonathan Burkardt found himself in behind after Robin Zentner’s long punt. The Germany U21 captain attempted to square for strike partner Karim Onisiwo, but the ball went through the legs of the Austrian. Die Werkself had seen a Kerem Demirbay effort flicked wide and Robert Andrich’s curling effort easily repelled by Zentner but will admit themselves they were fortunate to take a lead into half-time after Patrik Schick’s speculative effort from almost 25 yards out took a telling deflection off Alexander Hack to wrongfoot the Mainz goalkeeper.

Leverkusen’s 20-goal top scorer only lasted a few minutes of the second half, however, as he hobbled off to be replaced by Lucas Alario, who was immediately into the action but failed to trouble Zentner with a header. Yet it was the hosts who struck back to level things through a superb Martin free-kick, bending his shot through a cracking Leverkusen wall to leave Hradecky stranded. The Spaniard then looked to have helped complete the turnaround when he swung in a free-kick that Onisiwo headed in, but it was chalked off on review as Moussa Niakhate was in an offside position and interfering with play. To rub salt into the wound, the visitors would go on to take the lead again themselves when Alario latched onto a heavy touch from Moussa Diaby and lashed it high past Zentner. But the 05ers didn’t take it lying down and one of their own substitutes, Boetius, volleyed a miscued clearance sweetly into the top corner. And Bo Svensson’s side got the result their efforts probably deserved when Ingvartsen – another man off the bench – took advantage of a pinball in the box to poke home a late winner.</article></p>
